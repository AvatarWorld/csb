Cloth to cloth collision can be observed clearly without bending constraints, could weaken them.
Need to open stiffness to the constructor of bending constraints.
TEST
--
Add static collision planes
Change the param name from _positions to io_particles in constraints 
Add a create constraint template function to the solver
Set gravity in solver
Set damping in solver
