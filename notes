Cloth to cloth collision can be observed clearly without bending constraints, could weaken them.
TEST
--
Add static collision planes
smooth shading
energy test for solver
clone test
move constructor lists to .cpp

FIXESS
currently masses must be set before constraints are generated
currently static collisions need to be updated (cell and table size),
when adding a trimesh
